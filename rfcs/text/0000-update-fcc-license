# Summary

Update our FCC license to more closely match our use of handheld UHF radios and repeater.

# Motivation

We are currently violating two laws:

Using our radios north of Line A
Using a repeater without a license

# Detailed Proposal

I recommend we ammend our FCC license to bring us into compliance.

# Drawbacks

This will cost $230.

# Alternatives

We could consider other frequency coordinatrs. I contacted four from [this list](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/industrial-business/industrial-business-licensing).


# Prior Art

I don't know how other orgs have handled these issues.

# Implementation Plan

I have contacted the FCC and learned that in order to approve us to operate north of Line A we must work with a frequency coordinator. I have contacted multiple frequency coordinators and found one who has offered to have the license amended for $230. He says he is confident we will be approved to operate north of line a at 5 watts, and we may be able to operate the repeater at a higher power if Canada doesn't object.

# Accessibility

This change will be transparent to users of our radios. They will continue to operate as before.

# Sustainability

Creating a relationship with a frequency coordinator will make future changes easier.

# Sunset

Our current FCC license expires 10/10/2027. I don't know whether the process of amending the license will extend that. License expiration would be a natural time to reconsider whether the license is a good fit for our needs. 

# Unresolved questions

Is my currently selected vendor, Forest Industries Telecommunications, the best fit for us?
